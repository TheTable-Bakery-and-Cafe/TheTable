# Overview

I Julio Cesar Tavarez made this webpage for a local Bakery called the Table. I wanted to make a page easy for them to control update prices, add items and remove items from their webpage


[Video for The Table]([http://youtube.link.goes.here](https://youtu.be/1Qe_ihLbGP4))

# Development Environment

I used MJS, javascript HTML and CSS. with the basics learning API I was able to pull the data from a JSON file.

# Useful Websites

I had to get a lot of help from youtube and github.



# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would maybe change it to be pulling from a csv file rather then a JSON file.
- I would also chage some of the pictures and make them look more professional.
- I would change the footer to make it more apealing for users.
