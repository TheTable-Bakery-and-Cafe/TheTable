These are of a simple api request and I have had a desire to learn more about api. you can see in the javascript file how i pull the data and refure to it.

The database or the api I ampulling from is a MJS file where it has names of food and prices that the store uses. please do Not make any changes to this unless you are the store owner as this is going to be used for their buisness.
